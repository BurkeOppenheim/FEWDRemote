## Guts of HTTP Request

```
1. types in google.com
2. hits enter
3. the browser (Chrome) technical term is _client_ looks up the domain name on the DNS.
4. forwards a HTTP REQUEST to that IP Address
5. that IP Address is the location of what we call a *web server*
6. web server issues a HTTP Response with a CODE (200, 404 etc) and a BODY (which is contents of google.com, or error message, etc)
7. response is received by the web browser (Chrome) and Chrome is a program who's only job is to parse out the response and __render__ it

HTML =-> if we can speak HTML, then we can WRITE HTML, then we cn direct Chrome to parse our HTML into things like text fields, etc

page shows up, lol
