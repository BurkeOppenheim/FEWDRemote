# Review

-

Let's begin with some quick review

-

### Exercise
**[Consider this repo](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials/RelativePathsReview)**.
You are given several "websites". However they are set up in strange configurations! 
**For Each Folder**
1. **WITHOUT** rearranging the files, link the proper css folders in the **`HEAD`** section
2. If you do it right, hovering over the page in the browser will cause it to change colors

-

### Review: CSS essentials
Let's return to our **[classnotes](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials/cookie-recipe-starter_fewd627)** from last lecture.

# Practical CSS3 Usecases

-

These are examples of CSS3 uses that we will either cover **today** or **at some point** in the duration of the course.

-

#### Exercise
See if you can implement some of the more simple ones outlined here into one of your websites (either the resume or the Wendy Bite).

-

#### CSS Use Cases
Here are some interesting use cases where CSS3 in particular becomes super handy.

-

#### Animations
You can do some really awesome work with animating your elements.
* **[Spinner](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/42730)**
* **[Repeating, multiple animations](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4270)**

-

#### Transitions
Transitions are animations that are triggered usually by some form of user interaction.
* **[Hover Effects](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4268)**

-

#### Pseudo Selectors
Psuedo classes allow us to style specific types of element features, **i.e.** the **:hover** pseudo selector can be used to style an element as the user puts his mouse over it.
* **[Menu Hover Effect](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4957)**
Other examples of pseudo selectors: **:visited**, **:after**, etc

-

#### Overflows
Keep track of content and determine how it should behave if there is more content than space in the container.
* **[Overflow Example](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4165)**

-

#### Grids
This one is super expansive and you could literally teach an entire course on this. For now, take a look at a few examples / problems to gain perspective on this.
* **[Vertically and Horizontally Center](http://fewd.us/jargon/#/problem/10099)**
* **[Three Column Grid](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4258)**
* **[Flex Align/Justify](http://fewd.us/jargon/#/problem/10100)**
* **[Flex Direction](http://fewd.us/jargon/#/problem/10097)**
* **[Flex Wrap](http://fewd.us/jargon/#/problem/10098)**
